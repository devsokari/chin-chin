    <h1>How to make Chin Chin</h1>
    <p>
        Chin chin is a very popular Nigerian snack and it 
        also comes in a savory version too which is more 
        popular in Ghana (a west African country).
        The savory version uses a lot of onion, ginger with
        chili powder.

        It's very common to see this snack being made during
        festive seasons in Nigeria but since my kids love it 
        so much I make it every now and then.

    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <p>
        Chin chin can be easily prepared at home without much 
        efforts. All the ingredients you need are all pantry 
        staples and everything comes together in about 30 
        minutes from start to finish.

        In this recipe, I have added cinnamon and cayenne pepper
        just for a little bit zing!
    </p>
    
    <h2>What you'll need</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you will need to get:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper(optional)</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Cinnamon or Nutmeg</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These snacks are great for teatime, movie nights, game nights or anytime snack</p>

    <h3>How to check if the oil is hot enough for frying</h3>
    <p>To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough inside the oil.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the dough stays at the bottom for a long time, then the oil needs to be heated up a little more.</li>
        <li>If the dough rises too rapidly, then you may need to turn down the heat a little bit; otherwise, the chin chi will brown too quickly</li>
        <li>If the dough gradually floats to the surface of the oil, then the oil is just right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Donâ€™t be in a haste to eat your chin chin, let it cool down properly in order for you to enjoy the crunch.</li>
        <li>If you are using powdered milk just dissolve 2 Tbs of powder milk in 8Tbsp of water then use the required amount in the recipe (6 to 7 Tbsp) and drink the rest!</li>
        <li>If you plan to store your chin chin, be sure to let it cool down completely before storing it in an airtight container. This will make the chin chin remain crisp and last longer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Mix the Flour, baking powder, Sugar, and Nutmeg together in a Bowl</li>
        <li>Add the Egg, Melted Butter and Milk to the dry mixture and mix together until a dough is formed and knead the dough for a couple of minutes (about 2 to 4 minutes)</li>
        <li>Roll the dough it out into a thin sheet of about a 1/4 to 1/6 inch thickness and use a pizza cutter or a knife to cut the dough into tiny pieces as shown in the video above</li>
